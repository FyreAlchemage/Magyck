# Magyck: Ancient Sorcery
A mod adding in my own kind of arcane energy and powers. Nothing is added yet; I have to figure out where to begin.

## Features:
* An energy system like Thaumcraft's Aura, but you will be able to actually see it
* Highly customizable spells will allow you to do almost anything
* Customizable alignment system - you will be able to add your own alignment values
* New friends and foes you will encounter on your travels
* Mod integration - currently there are plans for blood magic integration

If you have suggestions for this mod, open an issue and give a detailed description of your idea. Ideas are welcomed and greatly needed.
